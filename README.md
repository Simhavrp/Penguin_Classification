This penguin classification project involves predicting the sex of penguins based on various physical features like bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, species, island, and year. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and scaling the features. A logistic regression model is implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy to classify penguins into male or female categories. Hyperparameters such as learning rate and the number of iterations are tuned to improve model accuracy, achieving a high accuracy level in predicting penguin sex based on the provided features.
